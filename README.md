Steps to run the Algorithm: 

1) The program prompts the user to enter any 4*4 graph. 
2) Enter any random 4*4 integers one by one. 
3) As soon as the limit for the integer reaches, the algorithm will print the inserted matrix in a sorted manner. 
4) After it has been inserted, it will find shortest path for all vertices and  Distance of source vertex from itself is always 0.
